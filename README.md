# Blog Platform
The goal of this project is to create a blog platform where users can create, manage, and interact with blog posts and comments. Instead of using a traditional REST API, youâ€™ll build a GraphQL API, which allows frontend clients to query exactly the data they need, improving efficiency and flexibility in data fetching.

### Key components of the project include:<br>
- Django
- GraphQL
- Unittest
- Svelte
